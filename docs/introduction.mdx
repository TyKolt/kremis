**Kremis** is a minimal, deterministic, graph-based cognitive substrate implemented in Rust.

It functions solely as a mechanism to **record**, **associate**, and **retrieve** structural relationships derived from grounded experience.

<Warning>
  **Work in Progress** — Features incomplete. Breaking changes expected.
</Warning>

<Note>
  The system does not *understand*. It contains only the structure of the signals it has processed.
</Note>

## Why Kremis

| Problem | How Kremis addresses it |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Hallucination** | No fabricated data. Every result traces back to real ingested signals. Explicit "not found" for missing data. |
| **Opacity** | Fully inspectable state. No hidden layers, no black box. Every result traces back to a graph path. |
| **Lack of grounding** | Zero pre-loaded knowledge. All structure emerges from real signals, not assumptions. |
| **Non-determinism** | Same input, same output. No randomness, no floating-point arithmetic in core. |
| **Data loss** | ACID transactions via `redb` embedded database. Crash-safe by design. |

## Architecture Overview

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **kremis-core** | Deterministic graph engine (pure Rust, no async) |
| **apps/kremis** | HTTP server + CLI (tokio, axum, clap) |
| **apps/kremis-mcp** | MCP server bridge for AI assistants (rmcp, stdio) |

## Design Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Minimal">
    No pre-loaded knowledge. No plugins. No configuration beyond what's needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deterministic">
    Same input always produces the same output. BTreeMap everywhere, no HashMap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grounded">
    Every piece of data traces back to an ingested signal. Nothing is invented.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Honest">
    Explicit "not found" responses. No guessing, no hallucination.
  </Step>
