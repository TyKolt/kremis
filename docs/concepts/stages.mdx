Kremis tracks the maturity of the graph through **developmental stages** based on the count of stable edges (edges with weight ≥ 10).

<Note>
  Stages are **informational only** — they do not gate functionality.
</Note>

## Stage Progression

| Stage | Name | Stable Edge Threshold |
|-------|------|-----------------------|
| **S0** | Signal Segmentation | 0 |
| **S1** | Pattern Crystallization | 100 |
| **S2** | Causal Chaining | 1,000 |
| **S3** | Recursive Optimization | 5,000 |

## What Each Stage Represents

<Steps>
  <Step title="S0 — Signal Segmentation">
    Initial stage. The graph is building basic structure from incoming signals. Few or no stable patterns yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="S1 — Pattern Crystallization">
    Patterns are emerging from repeated signals. At least 100 edges have been reinforced to stability (weight ≥ 10).
  </Step>
  <Step title="S2 — Causal Chaining">
    Strong interconnections are forming. The graph contains meaningful chains of stable relationships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="S3 — Recursive Optimization">
    The graph is well-connected and stable. Over 5,000 edges have been reinforced through repeated observation.
  </Step>
